2) The union of the elements of **any subcollection** of $\tau$ is in $\tau$.
3) The intersection of the elements of **any finite subcollection** of $\tau$ is in $\tau$.

Front: Define a basis for the order topology on a set X with a simple order relation.
Back: Let $\beta$ be the collection of all sets of the following types:
1) All open intervals $(a,b)$ in X.

Basic
Front: Define rays of an ordered set.

$\pi_1(x, y) = y$ is called a projection of $X \times Y$ on its second factor.

START
Basic
Front: Given a topological space, how do you devise a basis for this space?
Back: Let X be a topological space. Suppose that $\textbf{C}$ is a collection of open sets of X such that for each open set U of X and each x in U, there is an element C of $\textbf{C}$ such that $x \in C \subset U$. Then $\textbf{C}$ is a basis for the topology of X.

START
Basic
Front: How do you check if a subbasis generates a topology?
Back: Since the topology generated by a subbasis S is define to be the collection of all unions of finite intersections of elements of S, it suffices to show that the finite intersection of elements of S form a basis for the topology. It then follows that the topology generate by a basis consists of all unions of the basis elements.

If $\tau$ and $\tau'$ are two topologies on X, then $\tau'$ is {{c1::finer}} than $\tau$ if $\tau \subseteq \tau'$ and is {{c1:: strictly finer}} than $\tau$ if $\tau \subset \tau'$. Thus $\tau$ is accordingly {{c1::coarser}} or {{c1:: strictly coarser}} than $\tau'$. If either $\tau \subseteq \tau'$ or $\tau' \subseteq \tau$ then the two or said to be {{c1:: comparable}}.

Let $\beta$ and $\beta'$ be bases for the topologies $\tau$ and $\tau'$ respectively on X. Then the following are equivalent:
1) $\tau'$ is {{c1::finer}} than $\tau$.
2) For each $x \in X$ and each basis element $B \in \beta$ containing x, there is a basis element $B' \in \beta'$ such that $x \in B' {{c2::\subseteq }} B$.

Open rays form a {{c1::subbasis}} for the order topology on X. Illustrate how.
Back Extra: Every basis element for the order topology equals a finite intersection of open rays.
The interval $(a,b)$ equals the intersection of $(a, +\infty)$ and $(-\infty, b)$. The terms $[a_0, b)$ and $(a, b_0]$, if they exist are themselves open rays.

END

START
Basic
Front: Show that open rays are open in the order topology.
Back: If the topology X (and corresponding ordered set) on which the rays are defined has a largest element $b_0$ then the open ray $(a, +\infty)$ is the basis element $(a, b_0]$. If X has no largest element then $(a, +\infty)$ equals the union of all basis elements of the form $(a, x),\ x>a$. Since arbitrary unions of open sets(basis elements) is open, it follows that the term is open. In an analogous manner, the same can be shown for $(-\infty, a)$.

The order topology on $X = \{1,2\} \times \mathrm{Z}_+$ in the dictionary order is {{c1::not the discrete topology}}. Explain.
Back Extra: Most one point sets are open but the one point set $2 \times 1$. This is because any open set that contains that point must contain a basis element about it and any basis element about $2 \times 1$ contains points of the $a_i$ sequence.

The order topology on $Z^+$ is the {{c1::discrete topology}} for every {{c1::one-point set}} is open. Discuss the nature of the basis elements.
Back Extra: For $n>1$, the one point set $\{n\} = (n-1,n+1)$ is a basis element. For $n=1$, the one-point set $\{1\} = [1,2)$ is a basis element.
