# Probability density function and probability mass function

For the case of discrete random variable, the probaility of each distinct outcome can be clearly specified. It is given by:

P(X=x) = Number of favourable outcomes/Total number of outcomes

Discretizing the space into a finite set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive bins allows one to define the probability mass function. For a given interval, probability mass function is then given by:

P(a<=X<=b)  = Number of favourable outcomes/Total number of outcomes
			= sum(P(X=x)) from a to b
			
Sum of probability masses must be equal to one.
			
In the event of a continuous random variable, the probability of any particular outcomes is zero as it is the area of a line(probability is the area under a curve). The probability density function however, can be defined for a point by considering an infinitesimal width about the point. As such, because the probability density is in fact a density, its value can be greater than 1.

However, the integral of the probability density function over the whole state space of the random variable must be equal to 1.
